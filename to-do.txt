Possible additions/to-do:
1- Add Clebsch-Gordan coefficient option as input (generalization for future projects)
2- Integral over a closed contour
3- Check the fact that the analytic continuation formula holds both with +- and -+
4- Check the intKey to store the result of integrals also with the bool
5- Add sequential calls to different Minuit strategies
7- Modify mathematica code to include a pole search algorithm for cross checking pole positions and residues
8- Implement CDD parameterization to broaden the class of trials (hopefully helping find a good fit easier than the K-matrix one)
