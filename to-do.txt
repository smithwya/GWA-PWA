Possible additions/to-do:
1- Add Clebsch-Gordan coefficient option as input (generalization for future projects)
2- Integral over a closed contour
3- For Giorgio: Check the fact that the analytic continuation formula holds both with +- and -+
4- Check the intKey to store the result of integrals also with the bool: not necessary

7- Modify mathematica code to include a pole search algorithm for cross checking pole positions and residues

9- add other sheets (in this moment we have the 1st and and the 4th), so we have to pass from a binary to a more complex way to name them
10- For Giorgio: copy the good fits' input files in "BUONI"; then add input files to the farm's folder
11- Add a flag for just plotting and for the polesearch
12- has the polesearch to be done also in each jobs' run automatically?
13- change name of chisq functions and name of chisq values in the tree
14- make the format in which you pass the name of the input files to poleasearch consistent
15- calculation of residues: in development
