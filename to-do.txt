Possible additions/to-do:
1- Add Clebsch-Gordan coefficient option as input (generalization for future projects)
2- Integral over a closed contour
3- For Giorgio: Check the fact that the analytic continuation formula holds both with +- and -+
4- Check the intKey to store the result of integrals also with the bool: not necessary
5- Modify mathematica code to include a pole search algorithm for cross checking pole positions and residues
6- add other sheets (in this moment we have the 1st and and the 4th), so we have to pass from a binary to a more complex way to name them
7- For Giorgio: copy the good fits' input files in "BUONI"; then add input files to the farm's folder
8- residues as a criterion to characterize a pole

Remember:
1- CDD Kmat has positive coeffs whose positions in the list of fit parameters is hardcoded counted
