Possible additions/to-do:
1- Add Clebsch-Gordan coefficient option as input (generalization for future projects)
2- Integral over a closed contour
3- For Giorgio: Check the fact that the analytic continuation formula holds both with +- and -+
4- Check the intKey to store the result of integrals also with the bool: not necessary

7- Modify mathematica code to include a pole search algorithm for cross checking pole positions and residues

9- add other sheets (in this moment we have the 1st and and the 4th), so we have to pass from a binary to a more complex way to name them
10- For Giorgio: copy the good fits' input files in "BUONI"; then add input files to the farm's folder

12- has the polesearch to be done also in each jobs' run automatically? no

15- calculation of residues (also as a criterion to characterize a pole): in development
16- write in input file (or as an argument of the main) a string with the name of the minuit2's algorithms you want to call in sequence (ex. Simplex, Migrad). The subsequent minization is already thought to be generalized in this way: in progress
17-check the choice of cutoff
