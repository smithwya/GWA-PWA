Possible additions/to-do:
1- Add Clebsch-Gordan coefficient option as input (generalization for future projects)
2- Integral over a closed contour
3- For Giorgio: Check the fact that the analytic continuation formula holds both with +- and -+
4- Check the intKey to store the result of integrals also with the bool: not necessary
5- Add sequential calls to different Minuit strategies
7- Modify mathematica code to include a pole search algorithm for cross checking pole positions and residues
8- Implement CDD parameterization to broaden the class of trials (hopefully helping find a good fit easier than the K-matrix one): done
9- add other sheets (in this moment we have the 1st and and the 4th), so we have to pass from a binary to a more complex way to name them
10- For Giorgio: copy the good fits' input files in "BUONI"; then add input files to the farm's folder
11- Add a flag for just plotting and for the polesearch
12- has the polesearch to be done also in each jobs' run automatically?
13- change name of chisq functions
14- make the format in which you pass the name of the input files to poleasearch consistent
